# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring and enhancing the Sanskrit Rewrite Engine. The current implementation provides basic string transformation capabilities through multiple server variants, but lacks the proper package structure, consistent APIs, and sophisticated rule engine described in the project documentation. This specification defines an incremental approach to evolve the system from its current state to a robust, token-based transformation engine that can eventually support Pāṇini sūtra encoding and serve as a foundation for Sanskrit computational linguistics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Sanskrit Rewrite Engine, I want a proper Python package structure, so that the console scripts and imports work correctly and the project can be properly installed and distributed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed THEN the console scripts `sanskrit-web` and `sanskrit-cli` SHALL work without import errors
2. WHEN importing `sanskrit_rewrite_engine` THEN the module SHALL be found and importable
3. WHEN running `pytest` THEN the tests SHALL be discovered and executed from the correct directory structure
4. WHEN building the package THEN all declared dependencies SHALL be properly resolved and package data SHALL be included

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Sanskrit Rewrite Engine, I want a single, consistent FastAPI-based server implementation, so that I can avoid code duplication and API inconsistencies across multiple server variants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the web server THEN it SHALL use FastAPI with consistent endpoint definitions
2. WHEN making API requests THEN all endpoints SHALL return consistent response formats and status codes
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the server SHALL provide structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL provide automatic OpenAPI documentation at `/docs` and `/openapi.json`

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer managing project dependencies, I want right-sized dependency management, so that installation is fast and reliable without unused heavy libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the base package THEN it SHALL only include dependencies actually used by the core functionality
2. WHEN installing optional features THEN heavy dependencies like torch, transformers SHALL be in optional extras (gpu, web, dev)
3. WHEN running the basic server THEN it SHALL not require ML/GPU libraries unless explicitly requested
4. WHEN checking dependencies THEN unused libraries SHALL be removed or moved to appropriate extras

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the test suite, I want properly organized and executable tests, so that I can validate functionality and catch regressions during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pytest` THEN tests SHALL be discovered from the correct directory structure
2. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL test actual functionality rather than requiring a live server
3. WHEN adding new features THEN unit tests SHALL be included for core engine functionality
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL use mocked HTTP clients where possible for API testing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer concerned about security, I want proper CORS configuration and request validation, so that the API is secure and follows best practices for web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring CORS THEN origins SHALL be restricted to known development and production URLs, not wildcard "*"
2. WHEN receiving API requests THEN request payloads SHALL be validated against JSON schemas
3. WHEN handling large requests THEN content length limits SHALL be enforced to prevent abuse
4. WHEN processing requests THEN structured logging SHALL include request IDs and timing information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining code quality, I want proper project hygiene and CI/CD setup, so that code quality is maintained and the project follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL run linting, formatting, and type checking
2. WHEN building the project THEN CI SHALL run tests for both Python backend and frontend components
3. WHEN managing git THEN build artifacts like `node_modules` and `build/` SHALL be properly gitignored
4. WHEN developing THEN code formatting SHALL be enforced with black, isort, flake8, and mypy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the core engine, I want a minimal but functional Sanskrit transformation engine, so that the system can perform real linguistic processing beyond simple string replacement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Sanskrit text THEN the system SHALL tokenize input into meaningful linguistic units
2. WHEN applying transformations THEN the system SHALL use a rule-based approach with ordered rule application
3. WHEN rules are applied THEN the system SHALL produce traces showing which rules fired and in what order
4. WHEN loading rules THEN the system SHALL support JSON-based rule definitions for easy extensibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user of the Sanskrit processing API, I want stable and well-documented endpoints, so that I can integrate the engine into other applications and understand its capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN endpoints SHALL provide consistent request/response formats
2. WHEN using the API THEN comprehensive OpenAPI documentation SHALL be available at `/docs`
3. WHEN making requests THEN the API SHALL support both simple text processing and detailed rule tracing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the API SHALL return structured error responses with helpful messages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for future enhancements, I want extensible architecture foundations, so that the system can evolve toward sophisticated Pāṇini sūtra encoding without major rewrites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the core engine THEN it SHALL use interfaces that can support future token-based processing
2. WHEN implementing rules THEN the system SHALL support metadata and rule references for future sūtra encoding
3. WHEN processing text THEN the architecture SHALL allow for future integration of linguistic analysis components
4. WHEN building APIs THEN they SHALL be designed to accommodate future sophisticated transformation capabilities

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer working on frontend integration, I want proper frontend development workflow, so that the React application can be developed and built consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the frontend THEN build artifacts SHALL be excluded from version control
2. WHEN setting up development THEN clear documentation SHALL explain the frontend development workflow
3. WHEN building the frontend THEN the process SHALL be automated and reproducible
4. WHEN the frontend connects to the backend THEN proxy configuration SHALL be properly documented and configured
