RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Mathematical translation accuracy is low (0.00%). Consider expanding the symbolic computation engine and adding more Vedic mathematics sutra implementations.
2. Programming generation accuracy is low (0.00%). Enhance the domain mapper with more programming language patterns and algorithmic templates.
3. Cross-domain mapping accuracy is low (0.00%). Improve semantic mapping algorithms and add more domain-specific transformation rules.
4. Semantic preservation rate is low (0.00%). Implement more sophisticated semantic analysis and concept preservation validation.
