Generated: 2025-08-12 14:18:11

PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
-------------------------
1. MATHEMATICAL: Low math translation accuracy (0.00%). Expand symbolic computation engine and Vedic mathematics implementations.
2. PROGRAMMING: Low code generation accuracy (0.00%). Enhance domain mapping with more programming patterns.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------
1. Regularly run benchmarks to monitor performance trends
2. Expand test corpora to cover more linguistic phenomena
3. Implement continuous integration for benchmark regression testing
4. Consider adding more Vedic mathematics sutras for mathematical accuracy
5. Enhance cross-domain mapping capabilities for better semantic preservation
