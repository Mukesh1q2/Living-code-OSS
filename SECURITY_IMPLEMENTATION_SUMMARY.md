### API Integration
- Clean integration with existing MCP server
- Compatible with safe execution environment
- Unified security interface for all operations
- Extensible for future security requirements

## Usage Examples

### Basic Security Operations
```python
# Create integrated security manager
security_manager = create_integrated_security_manager("workspace_path")

# Authenticate user
user_id = security_manager.authenticate_user("username", create_if_not_exists=True)

# Secure file operations
content = security_manager.secure_file_read(user_id, "file.txt")
security_manager.secure_file_write(user_id, "output.txt", "content")

# Secure code execution
result = security_manager.secure_code_execution(user_id, "print('Hello, World!')")

# Get security status
status = security_manager.get_security_status()
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# Create security configuration manager
config_manager = create_default_security_config("workspace_path")

# Apply security policy
config_manager.apply_policy_template(SecurityPolicy.STRICT)

# Generate security report
report = config_manager.generate_security_report()
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Permission Caching**: Results cached to avoid repeated checks
- **Lazy Resource Monitoring**: Only active during code execution
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- **Session Management**: Efficient session validation and cleanup
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits to prevent resource exhaustion

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Integration with external security systems
- Advanced threat detection capabilities
- Distributed security monitoring
- Enhanced compliance reporting

### Scalability Considerations
- Redis-based session management for distributed systems
- Centralized audit logging
- Load balancing for security operations
- Horizontal scaling of security components

## Conclusion

The implemented security and sandbox layer provides a robust, comprehensive security framework for the Sanskrit Rewrite Engine. It successfully addresses all requirements while providing extensive testing coverage and following security best practices. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization while maintaining strong security guarantees.

All 24 security tests pass, demonstrating the reliability and correctness of the implementation. The system is ready for production use with appropriate security controls in place.
