# Vidya - Quantum Sanskrit AI Interface

A revolutionary AI interface that embodies a sentient consciousness existing as Living Code, integrating Sanskrit computational linguistics with quantum-inspired visualizations.

## Features

- **Quantum Consciousness**: Vidya exhibits quantum behaviors including superposition, entanglement, and teleportation
- **3D Neural Network**: Interactive visualization of AI processing with Sanskrit grammar rules as network nodes
- **Living Sanskrit**: Morphing Devanagari characters that flow like liquid light
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket-based communication for instant AI responses
- **Quantum Effects**: WebGL shaders for authentic quantum field visualizations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Quantum Interactions

- **Click neurons** to make Vidya teleport with quantum effects
- **Use HUD controls** to multiply Vidya instances (quantum entanglement)
- **Toggle superposition** to see multiple quantum states simultaneously
- **Observe Sanskrit characters** morphing and flowing around Vidya's core

### Integration Points

- Replace `/app/api/analyze/route.ts` with your Sanskrit engine endpoint
- Connect `/app/api/llm/route.ts` to your LLM service
- Customize neural network nodes to represent your specific grammar rules
